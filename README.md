# Projet_S4_Serveur

This repository is a project of REST API of an Android application FindMyFuel which was a group work of my studies of computer science at IUT d'Orsay, Universit√© Paris-Sud. 

The APIs are realized with the principe of REST and the SLIM Micro Framework.

The document on french of each API is on https://app.gitbook.com/@findmyfuel/s/findmyfuel/

English tutoriat is here : https://www.androidhive.info/2014/01/how-to-create-rest-api-for-android-app-using-php-slim-and-mysql-day-12-2/

The url, login, password and data base are no longer available because they have been deleted on the server of IUT d'Orsay even though they are in some code of configuration of database.
